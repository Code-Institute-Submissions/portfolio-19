# Portfolio (Third Milestone Project | Code Institute)


## UX (User Experience)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is the ability to present my professional profile, my skills and my abilities as a software developer for recruiters, employers and potential partners that are looking for a full stack developer.
The website is fully responsive, has a consistent flow and an intuitive navigation.

**User Goals:**
* A website where the developer’s works can easily be found with live website and GitHub repository attached.
* Information about the developer’s skills proficiency.
* A contact form where the developer can be contacted directly.
* To be able to see the developer’s CV on a new tab instead of having to download it.

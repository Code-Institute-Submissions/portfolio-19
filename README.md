# Portfolio (Third Milestone Project | Code Institute)


## UX (User Experience)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is the ability to present my professional profile, my skills and my abilities as a software developer for recruiters, employers and potential partners that are looking for a full stack developer.
The website is fully responsive, has a consistent flow and an intuitive navigation.

#### **User Goals:**
* A website where the developer’s works can easily be found with live website and GitHub repository attached.
* Information about the developer’s skills proficiency.
* A contact form where the developer can be contacted directly.
* To be able to see the developer’s CV on a new tab instead of having to download it.

#### **User Stories:**

**Emily S.**

*“As a recruiter I want to be able to find with easy the live website of the projects the developer has done in the past. The ideal website would have a section with these with a frame of the project. When I click on these frames I would expect it to redirect me to the live project.”*

**Jill G.**

*“Having a small startup, I’m always looking for partners for new projects. It’s very important when I’m in a portfolio website that I can easily find a way to contact the developer, ideally with a built-in form. Also, I feel more connected to the developer if there’s a picture of him/ her on the about me section.”*

**Mr. Bridgeman**

*“When I’m looking for a new employee it’s important to be able to see the developers code and what skills he or she have already learned. When looking through a portfolio I expect the skills section to be easily readable and to clearly show how much of each skill the developer knows approximately. I also expect a link to the developer’s GitHub repository, so I can go read the developer’s code.”*

#### **Site Owner Goals:**

* Receive interview offers through use of contact form.
* Be able to attract attention to my projects.
* Sell myself in a profession but still personal way.

**Requirements:**

* Navigate through the sections of the portfolio in one single page.
